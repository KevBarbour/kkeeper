                remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
                transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

                This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be
                terminated by kkeeper at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
                termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether

                expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without

                has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do
                not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
